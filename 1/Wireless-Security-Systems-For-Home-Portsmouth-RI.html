Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
