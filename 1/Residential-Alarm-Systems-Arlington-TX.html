<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas.

As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals may learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
