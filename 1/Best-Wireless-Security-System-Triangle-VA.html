If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support cops response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  technique to burglary reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
