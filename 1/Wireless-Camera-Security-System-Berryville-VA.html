<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors guard your security system versus short-term rises that can enter through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones. Home automation is practical and easy, and wireless systems assist you automate your home that much easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home gadgets are by their very nature wireless, and most home security companies provide a home automation package with an app to remotely manage whatever on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, since you can, however automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to encrypt.

<p>While not a vital requirement for a home security system, all top companies provide a range of camera alternatives as add-ons. House owners can choose from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can tape footage when an alarm is triggered, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more.

Another location where Arlo excels is customer support.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
