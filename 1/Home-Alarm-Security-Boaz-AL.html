We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
