<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific very same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
