<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later created to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
