These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to a router and the web.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
