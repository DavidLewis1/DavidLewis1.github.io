In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
