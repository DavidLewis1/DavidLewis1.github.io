<p>Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are essential, these are the most convenient alternative to install and all of the recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>
