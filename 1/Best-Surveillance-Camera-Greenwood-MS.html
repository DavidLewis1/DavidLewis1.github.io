<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers totally free perks like person detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked just about half of the time and the camera consistently disconnected from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, in addition to when we made changes in the settings.</p>
