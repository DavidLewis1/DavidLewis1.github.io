<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems planned to summon police department workers, needs registration, evaluation of costs for excessive false burglar alarms, offers procedures for repeat offenders, and provides an effective date.

Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have additional sensing units and key fobs, too.</p>
