<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
