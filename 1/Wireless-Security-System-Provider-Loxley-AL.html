<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by.
