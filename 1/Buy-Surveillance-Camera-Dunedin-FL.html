<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Terrific clearness. I wanted to set up viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter signals, for example. However, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 monthly ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
