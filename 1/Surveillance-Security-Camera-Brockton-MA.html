Accessories such as wall brackets and camera real estates can assist to support and secure closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems from outdoor components. Interact with your alarm from anywhere by taking a look at live video, or answering your front door while you're at work. Smarter security options keep you in control when you are away.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

<p>A lot of modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup.
