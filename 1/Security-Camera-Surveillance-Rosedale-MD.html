<p>Secluded Areas - If a location around your business is secluded, chances are unsavory characters are going to detect that, making these spots popular for bring and preparing out theft.

Security cameras present near a dumpster can hinder this activity.

A local system does not have the capability to couple with other clever devices and can not be controlled from another location. Also a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to alert people nearby.</p>
