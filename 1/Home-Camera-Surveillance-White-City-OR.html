These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable television complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the taped video footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
