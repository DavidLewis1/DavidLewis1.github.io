<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
