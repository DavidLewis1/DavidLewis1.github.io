<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
