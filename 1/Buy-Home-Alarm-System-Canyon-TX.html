<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it detects an intruder; a convenient intercom function that enables the device to serve as a clever doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.
