<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Knowing enables someone to find what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Imagine a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are searching for in the recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective option for catching criminals and gathering proof.</p>

When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
