Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
