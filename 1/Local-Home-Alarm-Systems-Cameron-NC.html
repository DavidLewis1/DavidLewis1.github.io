<h3>Monitored Home Security in North Carolina</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic.
