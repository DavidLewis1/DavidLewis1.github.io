<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might revisit this evaluation.
