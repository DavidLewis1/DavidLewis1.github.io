If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops response to alarmed properties) a expensive and ineffective  technique to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
