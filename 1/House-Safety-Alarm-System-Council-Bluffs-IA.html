<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
