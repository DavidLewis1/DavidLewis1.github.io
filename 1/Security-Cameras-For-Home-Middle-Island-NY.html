<p>Camera, or closed-circuit tv (CCTV), are becoming an increasingly more prevalent feature of American life. Fears of terrorism and the accessibility of ever-cheaper cameras have actually sped up the trend much more. The use of advanced systems by cops and other public security authorities is particularly uncomfortable in a democratic society.
