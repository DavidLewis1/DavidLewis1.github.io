<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can pick whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station.

Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer.</p>

With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to get sensors needed to manage your equipment consisting of enabling, disabling and sending you immediate signals. As soon as a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, e-mail, text, or web portal.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
