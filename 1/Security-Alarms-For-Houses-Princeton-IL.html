<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
