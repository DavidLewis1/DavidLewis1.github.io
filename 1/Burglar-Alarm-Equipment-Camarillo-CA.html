<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get completely included, professional-grade security services that are simple to install and simple to use. Honeywell Total Link cameras represent the next generation of residential video surveillance equipment.

<p>At night, though it lacks the complete IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're placing it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to select moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Just a couple years ago, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of big names using costly, stiff plans with little versatility and hostile, long-term agreements.

Tech is expected to make our lives simpler and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
