<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as simple to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensors had been triggered. We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false notifies).
