<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
