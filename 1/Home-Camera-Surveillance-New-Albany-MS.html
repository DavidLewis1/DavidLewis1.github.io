The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
