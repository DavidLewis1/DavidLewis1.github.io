The camera includes a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.
