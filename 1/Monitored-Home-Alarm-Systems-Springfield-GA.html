Much like the Nest Thermostat E, it utilizes data from other clever gadgets to find out about your temperature level preferences and sends you alerts to alert you of any modifications.</p>
<p>There's no devoted center involved here - each camera connects straight to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
