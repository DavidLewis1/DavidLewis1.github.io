<h3>Home Security Alarm Installation in Florida</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
