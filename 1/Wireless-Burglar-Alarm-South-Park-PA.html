Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Window sensors are easily hid behind blinds or curtains, and door sensors are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe.
