<p>C. False Alarm System. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Internet, Select either landline or the proper interactive service. Select billing period: Yearly or monthly. We get a 15% prepay discount from our UL central station provider which we pass on to our annual consumers. This is NOT an agreement, rather an annual prepay discount. When I ultimately entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies simply to let the person being seen understand they're being seen, and you can select to tape video or pictures and save them to your clever device on an impulse.</p>
