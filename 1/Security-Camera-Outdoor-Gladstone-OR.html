<p>Another essential subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image.

Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
