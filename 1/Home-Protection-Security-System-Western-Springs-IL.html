<p>The majority of modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which allow operators to enjoy a few of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup.

Frequently, the simple presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated trespassers. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or damaged by the more figured out intruders. They might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks if intruders can not see any security cameras.</p>
