It makes no sense that we do not have equivalent laws for video recording.

Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
