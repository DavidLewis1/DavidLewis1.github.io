The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

Even more, there can be fringe benefits to a DIY system due to the fact that they're generally much easier to move to another home if you move.
