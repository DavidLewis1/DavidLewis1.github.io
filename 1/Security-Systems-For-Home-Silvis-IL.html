If the system was not installed during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and gaining access to hard areas that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power blackouts. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of a failure, however long term blackouts will lead to the system losing power. When choosing a wired system, it's likewise crucial to think about how long you plan to stay at the exact same house.
