<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
