<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the duty of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you mean to store and the length of time you plan to keep documented video. The video is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
