Not just is the Arlo fast to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Just a couple years ago, the home security industry was dominated by a few huge names offering costly, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements.

Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You should play this at complete volume or it will not work).
