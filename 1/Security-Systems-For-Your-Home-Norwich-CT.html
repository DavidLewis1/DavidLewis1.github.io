<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
