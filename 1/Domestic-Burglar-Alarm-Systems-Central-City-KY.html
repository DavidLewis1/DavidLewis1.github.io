Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is generally a simple procedure, and it is often possible to bring all of your existing sensors and devices to the new wireless system. If you have old hardwired gadgets, you can user interface them with a wireless panel by adding a wired to wireless converter, such as the Honeywell 5800C2W.</p>
