<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a expensive and inefficient  technique to burglary decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
