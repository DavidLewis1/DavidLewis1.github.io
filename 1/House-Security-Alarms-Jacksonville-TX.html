<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was developed for property owners. It needs to be installed by an expert alarm installation group and, as soon as set up, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for big residential or commercial properties and are often more pricey than a wireless home security system.
