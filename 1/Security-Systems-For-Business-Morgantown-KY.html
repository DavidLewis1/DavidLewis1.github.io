Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
