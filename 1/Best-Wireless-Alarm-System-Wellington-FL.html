<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and therefore offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
