Occupants, unlike house owners, typically avoid making permanent changes to their homes.

In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be established at different homes in the future, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensors, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
