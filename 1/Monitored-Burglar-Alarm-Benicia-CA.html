Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
