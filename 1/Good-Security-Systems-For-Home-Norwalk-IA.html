<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal building and construction.

Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
