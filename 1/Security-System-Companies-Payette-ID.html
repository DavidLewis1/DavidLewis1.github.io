<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop.
