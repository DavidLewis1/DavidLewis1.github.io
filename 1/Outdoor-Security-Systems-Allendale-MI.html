<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even activate incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to strive to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to guy.

Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You must play this at full volume or it will not work).
