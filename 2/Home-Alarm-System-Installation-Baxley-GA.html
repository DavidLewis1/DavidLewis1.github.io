The greatest consideration when choosing which type of PoE switch to buy is the variety of cameras that will be on your system.

When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
