<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
