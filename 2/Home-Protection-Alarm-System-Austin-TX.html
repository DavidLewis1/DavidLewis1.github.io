Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
