<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
