<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
