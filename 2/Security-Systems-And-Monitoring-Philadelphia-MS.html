Both also lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to cut down on incorrect alerts.</p>

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other elements can easily be established at different homes later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also enable remote control of the system and general home automation.
