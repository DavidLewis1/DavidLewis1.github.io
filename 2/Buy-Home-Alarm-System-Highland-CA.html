Wireless equipment can likewise be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
