<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in consumer reviews, and it delivers a crisp picture up to 32 feet.

A great deal of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary advantages like person detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 each month.)
