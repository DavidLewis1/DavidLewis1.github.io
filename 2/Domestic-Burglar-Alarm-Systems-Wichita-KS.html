<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to tap into their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for tape-recorded video. In some cases it's helpful to be able to see what happened prior to or after a visitor approaches your door.
