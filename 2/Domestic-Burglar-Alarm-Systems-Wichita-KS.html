<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to tap into their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for tape-recorded video. In some cases it's helpful to be able to see what happened prior to or after a visitor approaches your door. For that, you'll need a doorbell that utilizes pre-buffering to tape the action taking place before motion is found or the doorbell is pushed.</p>

The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They could peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it might be a crime, yet the same individual could put a surveillance camera then remotely view a person within the personal privacy of their home. Most notably, it is not against the chastening code.</p>
