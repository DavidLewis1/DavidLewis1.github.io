<p>The very first (and most obvious, for sure) component of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends on your specific needs and budget; are you putting them inside or outdoors? Is 1080P a big sufficient resolution?

These are very important questions to be considered when choosing security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>
