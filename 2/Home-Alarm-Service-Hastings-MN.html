<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
