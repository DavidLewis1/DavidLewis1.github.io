<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
