<p>Residence: Best for wise homes-- Abode offers you unique equipment functions plus flexible professional monitoring. Rather the powerhouse combo.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the porch by a licensed electrical contractor (who takes place to be my hubby).
