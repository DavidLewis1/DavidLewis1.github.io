<h3>Wireless Home Security Camera Systems in California</h3>

These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to the web and a router.

Also, the Blink doesn't offer you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.
