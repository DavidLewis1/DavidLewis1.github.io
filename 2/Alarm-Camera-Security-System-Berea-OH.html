You could invest a similar amount for the best home security system, however they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. But, they're the very best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring. One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be a cost effective alternative for clients in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
