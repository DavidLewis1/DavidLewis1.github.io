<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.
