<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you mean to save and for how long you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
