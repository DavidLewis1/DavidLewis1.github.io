<h3>Safe Home Security System in Michigan</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>If you're a Google Homeowner, if you want a more attractive-looking system, or if you simply do not want to put security in the hands of Amazon (Ring's parent company), SimpliSafe is a versatile, affordable, and easy-to-use live-monitoring security alternative.

SimpliSafe also works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to arm and inspect the system using just voice commands. It doesn't deal with lots of third-party smart-home devices, though, and it isn't really useful without a monitoring subscription.</p>
