<h3>Safe Home Security System in Michigan</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

SimpliSafe also works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to arm and inspect the system using just voice commands. It doesn't deal with lots of third-party smart-home devices, though, and it isn't really useful without a monitoring subscription.</p>
