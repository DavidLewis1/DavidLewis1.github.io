<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
