<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
