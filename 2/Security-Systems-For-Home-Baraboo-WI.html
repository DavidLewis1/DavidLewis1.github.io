Lots of top security system companies might also offer environmental sensors, such as temperature level and humidity sensing units for fire and flood detection, smoke alarm, and carbon monoxide detectors to monitor indoor air quality in real time.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
