<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense prevention created to prevent both personal and home criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will lower crime and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>Often a wired system can be puzzled with local alarms. However, the two are drastically different. The main difference is that the wired system couple with the other smart home gadgets to develop a network of home security around your home. It can be managed remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (likewise known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to couple with other clever devices and can not be controlled from another location. Also a local alarm won't call the authorities; it merely sets off an audible siren to notify individuals close by.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
