<p>After purchasing, installing, and using these systems for eight months, we found 4 standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all supply an outstanding customer experience and intuitive, ingenious security tech.

ADT offers superior brand name acknowledgment (a powerful crime deterrent), Vivint aces home automation, and Frontpoint provides a high-support alternative for those who desire a structured, Do It Yourself system.</p>

<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera likewise serves as a motion detector. It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion found, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can respond to it right away. Moreover, the motion sensing unit here is much more sophisticated than the ones offered by adobe Starter Package. Because it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it only gets set off when it captures motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., people and animals. Furthermore, it does not get activated by small things. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most sophisticated motion sensors that get rid of all incorrect alarms and just gets set off when people approach it.</p>
