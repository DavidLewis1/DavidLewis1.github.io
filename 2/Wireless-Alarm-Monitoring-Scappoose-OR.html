<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop.
