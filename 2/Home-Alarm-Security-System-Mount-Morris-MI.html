The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
