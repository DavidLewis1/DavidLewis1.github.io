<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a sensational value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription prepare for additional cloud storage. But the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their mobility, impermanence and expandability. Renters, unlike homeowners, normally prevent making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can quickly be set up at various residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also permit remote control of the system and general home automation. If home automation is your main appeal, have a look at our list of top systems with home automation functions.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
