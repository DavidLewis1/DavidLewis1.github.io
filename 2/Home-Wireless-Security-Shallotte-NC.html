Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
