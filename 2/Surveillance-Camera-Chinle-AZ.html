<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
