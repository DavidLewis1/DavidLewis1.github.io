<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both animals and human beings.
