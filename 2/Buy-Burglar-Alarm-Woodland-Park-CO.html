<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make clients stay with them longer, because changing monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
