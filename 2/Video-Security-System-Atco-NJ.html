Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
