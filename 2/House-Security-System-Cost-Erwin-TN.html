<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day.
