You might spend a similar quantity for the very best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel.

IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>
