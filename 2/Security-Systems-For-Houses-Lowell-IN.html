Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.

With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
