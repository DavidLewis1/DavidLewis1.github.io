<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
