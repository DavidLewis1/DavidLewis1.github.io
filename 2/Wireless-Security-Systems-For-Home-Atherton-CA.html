However, you will have to pay for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) each month, and this does not featured professional monitoring.

This system may not be the best fit if you have a large lawn or sheds to secure. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't require a base station-- it links straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can connect the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser. Aside from providing easy access to recordings, the app allows you to adjust sensitivity so that you're not getting informs every two minutes.</p>
