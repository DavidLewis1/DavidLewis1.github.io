<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity avoidance created to avoid both personal and property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection.

The system can be established to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
