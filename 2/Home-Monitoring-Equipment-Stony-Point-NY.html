<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
