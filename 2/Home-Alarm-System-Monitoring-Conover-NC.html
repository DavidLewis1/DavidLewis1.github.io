The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also good metal construction.

This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
