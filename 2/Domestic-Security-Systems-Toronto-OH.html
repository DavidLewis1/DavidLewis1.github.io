When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they might be viewed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people may find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through extended surveillance.</p>
