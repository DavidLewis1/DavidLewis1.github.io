<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with information after the fact, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of recording storage area. A lot, in fact, that they need about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape the very same length of video footage.
