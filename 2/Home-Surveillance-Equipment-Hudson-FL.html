<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more competence to setup, and generally cost more than analog cameras. All sensors and detectors communicate with a control board.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for example.
