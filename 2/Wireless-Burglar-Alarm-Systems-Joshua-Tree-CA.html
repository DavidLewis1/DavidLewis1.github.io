<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
