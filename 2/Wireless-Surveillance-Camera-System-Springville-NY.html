<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the specific very same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
