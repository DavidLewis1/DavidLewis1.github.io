We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is developed by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect informs). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have crucial fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>

<p>Sensing units allow cameras to start and stop recording based upon time or motion detection. The one time where lag does become a little bit of an issue is between recording and finding motion. Because the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it detects motion.
