<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, usually avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at different properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too. Wireless security plans also allow remote control of the system and basic home automation. If home automation is your main appeal, check out our list of top systems with home automation features.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
