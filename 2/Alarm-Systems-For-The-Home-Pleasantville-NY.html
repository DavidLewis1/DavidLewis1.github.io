<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops reaction to alarmed homes) a costly and ineffective  technique to burglary decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
