<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal offense prevention created to avoid both individual and property crime and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
