<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
