<p>Flood lights are often used in combination with motion detectors. When sensing units detect motion, the lights brighten the surrounding location, which will permit you to see who is on your home and will potentially scare off burglars.

Flood lights can prevent vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
