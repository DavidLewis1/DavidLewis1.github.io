<p>One category where SimpliSafe has actually gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer support.

<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and once again in customer reviews, and it provides a crisp photo approximately 32 feet.

A lot of clever cameras can be configured to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any frustration.</p>
<p>I ask forgiveness to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is really simply a terrific name for a set that includes a Wink wise home center and a couple of security oriented sensors. You can't deactivate the system and arm. Rather, you turn informs on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or set off the siren.
