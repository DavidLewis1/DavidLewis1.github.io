<h3>Home Security System Companies in Arkansas</h3>
<p>Because it's more complicated than it must be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
