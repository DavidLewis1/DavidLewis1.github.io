<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will love. ADT is a household name, so we often check out their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of testing, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor.

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal activity prevention designed to avoid both personal and property criminal offense and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will reduce crime and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
