<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself. This choice is typically cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud.
