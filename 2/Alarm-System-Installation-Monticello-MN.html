We should note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
