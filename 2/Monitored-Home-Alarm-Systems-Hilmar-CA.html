The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve information after the fact, which implies that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage area.
