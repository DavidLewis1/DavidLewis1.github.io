This is also known as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing provocations that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>There are 2 outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.

On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that plainly stands out to alert burglars that your home is under surveillance.
