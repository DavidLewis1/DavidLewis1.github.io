As the cover asserts, this year might be a tipping point for Security, Monitoring & Smart Home-- After a year of growth, alarm companies prepare to weather a world of unknowns.

When any of the security sensing units are breached by an intruder, the control panel relays a message to the monitoring service or sets off your home-mounted alarm.</p>
<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds person detection, which makes for smarter smartphone signals-- and, in many cases, fewer incorrect signals. If the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area, you will not have to worry about it tape-recording or sending out an alert every time the pet strolls by. (We think this is a better feature if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks often pass.)
